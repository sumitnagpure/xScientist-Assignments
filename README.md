This GitHub repository contains my assignment solution for xScientist. It includes a Colab notebook for code and analysis, an SQL file for database operations, and an ER-diagram PNG image for database visualization. Your feedback is appreciated.

Files Included:
1. Colab Notebook:
   This Jupyter Notebook file contains a detailed explanation of the assignment's problem statement, my approach, code implementation, and analysis of results. It is a dynamic document that showcases my data analysis and modeling skills.

3. SQL File:
   The SQL file provided here contains the necessary scripts and queries used for database operations, data extraction, transformation, and other relevant tasks, depending on the assignment requirements.

4. ER-Diagram PNG Image:
   The ER-Diagram PNG image visually represents the database schema or entity-relationship model used in the assignment. It offers a clear and concise overview of the database structure and its relationships.
